Reinforcement Learning Project
------------------------------
A reinforcement learning project for the Introduction to Artificial Intelligence course I took in 2023.

The project makes use of Unity for the environment of the project, where an "imposter" RL agent attempts to find the "vent" object to achieve its goal.
It utilizes the ml-agents library.
